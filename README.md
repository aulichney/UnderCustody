# NY DOCCS Under Custody Data Visualization with Filters on X and Y Axes

## To Do:
- Update Y axis label to reflect user selection
- Change "y-axis" and "x-axis" text to be outside the dropdown
- Eliminate entries with no info for selected variables before plotting to prevent empty bars
- Eliminate age from x-axis selection options without breaking the code
- CSV data input
